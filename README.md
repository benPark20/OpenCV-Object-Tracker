# OpenCV-Object-Tracker

This is project utilizes a raspberry pi with a pi cam and a servo to track objects with the camera, keeping them centered in the frame.
It handles multiple object by only following the one that is the largest. It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 4B 2GB so it is very lightweight on the system.

## Features
- Color Tracking
- Supports any webcam
- Supports Custom Object tracking
- Hardware PWM over Software PWM
- Lightweight

## Planned upgrades
- Face Tracking
- Second servo axis for more robust tracking
